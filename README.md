# HashGeek
A simple utility for getting & verifying file hashes.

# Features
- Supports multiple hash algorithms, ranging from SHA1-512 and MD5
- Easily verify the hash of a file
- VirusTotal search

# Notes
This program requires PowerShell and **is meant to be run on Windows** *(in my testing, it doesn't work on Linux as i used WPF for the UI).*
In the future, i'm planning on supporting Linux by utilizing CLI.
